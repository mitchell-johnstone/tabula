Notes:
- Lithium Battery lasts for about a week (for split keyboard)
- Lithium Battery should come in white to have the end connection w/ a long cable (can trim later)
- items that come in packs of 2:
	- the power switch
	- the reset switch
	- the battery jack
	- the 5-pin socket
- the Kailh switches selected are red, since they seem to be a good starting point.
